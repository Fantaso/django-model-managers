  Django Model Managers App
</h1>

> Web app to test case Managers for models in Django. The App consists in listing on html page (http://localhost:8000/author-list/) all the Authors with the sum of copies sold of all their books.

<!-- build -->
<!-- [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-link] -->




Test case allows the user to visit website to view a list of all authors and their amount of books sold per author.

It is partly tested as only and was developed as showcase only.




How Django Models Managers Works:
- You can open the browser with the url http://localhost:8000/author-list to view the list of authors and all book's copies sold.
- You can open the browser with the url http://localhost:8000/author-list-complex to view the list of authors and all book's copies sold and number of books and only the authors who have sold more than 100 books.
